    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!-- Hey Thomas!-->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is 
      intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as 
      simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. 
      Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>The alt attribute is a name for the picture that is not the file name. So instead of the src being pic.png the alt text would be Dog pic. Title is a lower level
      information that describes more in depth what the picture is. It almost seems like the alt attribute is a title while the actual title attribute is more a description.
    </p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    <p> You would use &lt;dl&gt;&lt;/dl&gt; to create a list of definitions 
    </p>
     <dl>
          <dt>then you would use &lt;dt&gt;&lt;/dt&gt; to name a definition</dt>
          <dd>Followed by &lt;dd&gt;&lt;/dd&gt; to define it </dd>
     </dl> 
    
    <h4>Provide an example of link pointing to your favorite site &amp; create a style rule to change the background color of the link when the user hovers over it. </h4>
